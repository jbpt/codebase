GASPD: GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR STOCHASTIC PROCESS DISCOVERY
=========================================================

## About
GASPD is a new approach for discovering sound Stochastic Directed Action Graphs (SDAGs) from event logs.
The approach is grounded in stochastic grammatical inference algorithm coupled with a genetic optimization mechanism.
