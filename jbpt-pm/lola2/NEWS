LoLA 2.0
========

LoLA checks by explicit state space verification whether a place/transition net
satisfies a specified property. It offers a broad range of state space
reduction methods and specialised procedures for simple properties such as
reachability or deadlocks.

Compared to LoLA 1.x, LoLA 2.0 is a complete re-implementation. The following
major changes have been done:

* Unlike LoLA 1.x, LoLA 2.0 has a single executable. So there is no need for
  compile-time configuration any more.

* All properties are specified in a uniform language: CTL*. LoLA analyses the
  property and runs a suitable checker such as a CTL or LTL model checker, a
  reachability checker, or a deadlock checker. General CTL* model checking is
  not available, though.

* LTL model checking has not been present in LoLA 1.x. In LoLA 2.0, both CTL
  and LTL properties can be checked (currently without partial order reduction).

* The symmetry method has been extended to arbitrary properties. We
  automatically compute symmetries that preserve both net structure and formula.

* Output and status messages have been reshaped to make integration of LoLA
  into other tools even more easy.

* Advanced Bloom filters are available for state space compaction.

* Several sub-tasks can distribute their computations over multiple cores, if
  available.

* We up port additional atomic propositions like "DEADLOCK", "INITIAL",
  "FIREABLE(t)", and comparisons that involve several places, such as
  "p2 + 3 * p7 < 5 * p3". For coverabilty queries, the value "oo" has been
  introduced. This way, unboundedness of a place can be specified be "p >= oo".

On the other hand, high level net input is not (yet) supported.
