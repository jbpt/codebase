Setup and installation
----------------------

You need to configure LoLA by executing

     $ cd lola-2.0-RC1
     $ ./configure

The configuration should finish with a message like

     ============================================================
       Successfully configured 2.0-RC1.
       -> compile LoLA with `make'.
     ============================================================

Then, execute

     $ make

to compile LoLA. You may ignore potential compiler warnings. If
everything is OK, you should see a message like

     ============================================================
       Successfully compiled 2.0-RC1.
       -> check out LoLA's help with `src/lola --help'
       -> install LoLA to /usr/local/bin with `make install'
     ============================================================

This indicates that the LoLA binary `lola' has been successfully built
in the `src' directory.

To install LoLA, you may optionally execute

     $ sudo make install

to copy all required files to `/usr/local/bin'. An installed LoLA has
the advantage that LoLA can be called from anywhere and that you will
not need the `lola-2.0-RC1' directory any more. In the following, we
assume that LoLA has been installed and can be called by simply
executing `lola'.

You can change the installation directory by calling `./configure
--prefix=DIRECTORY'. Then, the required files will be installed to
`DIRECTORY/bin'.


Repository version
------------------

The following tools are necessary to compile LoLA from scratch:

- Autoconf
- Automake
- Flex
- GNU Bison
- GNU Gengetopt
- GNU Make
- GNU help2man
- GNU sed
- Kimwitu++

With these tools, execute

     $ autoreconf -i

and continue with the instructions in "Setup and installation".
